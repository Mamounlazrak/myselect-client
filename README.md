## Project Elevator Pitch

### What is the project about? 

Find the best eco-friendly restaurants in Lisbon

### How does it work? 

Discover a curated list of organic restaurants. Pick your favourite places and save them in your personal list 

### Why did I choose to work on this project? 

Among restaurant goers, a growing segment is represented by customers seeking for eco-friendly places. 
Big scale recommandation/reservation platforms like Trip Advisor or The Fork don't focus on that niche especially, this is where I perceived an unbundling opportunity.
