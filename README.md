# myselect - Full stack web application (MERN stack, responsive design)

## Project Elevator Pitch

### What is the project about? 

Find the best eco-friendly restaurants in Lisbon.

### How does it work? 

Discover a curated list of organic restaurants. Pick your favourite places and save them in your personal list.

### Why did I choose to work on this project? 

Among restaurant goers, a growing segment is represented by customers seeking eco-friendly places. 
Big scale recommandation/reservation platforms like Trip Advisor or The Fork don't focus on that niche especially, this is where I perceived an unbundling opportunity. 

## Technical challenges

- Google maps API working on local host but not on deployed version. For now this feature has been disabled (restaurant details).
